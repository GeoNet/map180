# New Zealand Maps

A pkg for making maps of New Zealand without a database.  

Most of the files in this project are autogenerated.  This is done by copying `map180_generate_test.go.txt` to the `map180` project as a Go test file `map180_generate_test.go` and then running the tests in `map180`.  This will output .go files into /tmp.

## Data Sources

* Natural Earth - http://www.naturalearthdata.com/
